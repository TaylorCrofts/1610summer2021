Git hub is one of the largest developer communities in the world.
It allows people to create, share, and develop software together through the use of its repositories!
People are able to see the different versions of edits that have been made by each member and see the
timeline in which the edits were made. So in a sense a Git is a type of software that documents Changes
with the purpose of allowing you to backtrack easily! like a code spread sheet.
